# Keras
My notes from a [RealPython mini-course on text classification](https://realpython.com/lessons/text-classification-keras-overview/).  
There is a [Google CoLab notebook](http://bit.ly/RP_NLP_Keras) as well.

Originally, Keras was a wrapper around a lower level API of Tensorflow (and other backends).
Since TensorFlow 2.0, Keras is part of TensorFlow (many of the APIs are still the same, you just access them through the TensorFlow modules).
